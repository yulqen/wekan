## Roles

It depends on role of user what drag drop is allowed https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/REST-API-Role

## Mobile Drag Drop

1. Click `Drag Handle Enabled/Disabled` button to enable drag handles

2. Use drag handles to move Board Icons, Swimlanes, MiniCards, Lists, Checklists, Checklist Items.

3. Use non-drag-handle area to to view other parts of board, by dragging board up/down/left/right, without moving any icons etc.

## 2 or more external screens of desktop or mobile

For each screen, you can enable or disable drag handles, because that setting is stored in browser localstorage, not to database. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/4715

Because this feature was added, `Drag Handle Enabled/Disabled` was moved to current place shown in above screenshot. https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/4734

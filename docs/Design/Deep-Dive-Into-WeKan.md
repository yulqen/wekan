- Whitelabel: Change product name and product image at login screen and board left top corner. Not changing favicon, because there are 100+ favicons for different devices.

- There Jan Dvorak IV https://github.com/StorytellerCZ commented chat: "We should do deep dive into WeKan!"
- So here is The Deep Dive!
- Questions for upcoming "This Week in MeteorJS", some already mentioned to be upcoming:
  - How to upgrade dependencies to Meteor 3.0 ? Some answer was to mention Meteor version at package dependency:
    <img src="https://wekan.fi/upgrade-meteor3-new.png" width="100%" alt="Meteor 3.0 upgrading dependencies" />
  - But what if adding dependency adds some more error messages? Probably that depends on error message, like here when
    trying to upgrade to Meteor 3.0 alpha 15: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/5142

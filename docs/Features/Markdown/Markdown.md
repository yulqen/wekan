UPDATE: Wekan now uses markdown-it and markdown-it-emoji plugin, see [Emoji page](Emoji)

## Numbered text

If in List titles you like to create numbered text like this:
```
3. Something
```
Write it this way (to escape dot), so it shows correctly:
```
3\. Something
```

Wekan uses GFM (Github Flavored Markdown).
We use the following project that ports GFM to meteor: https://github.com/wekan/markdown with updated newest markdown, that is fork of https://github.com/perak/markdown.

Newest Wekan uses newest markdown.

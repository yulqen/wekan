## Fullscreen Android app with Caddy and WeKan Server

These are mostly just notes to WeKan maintainer xet7 itself, how xet7 did get official WeKan Android Play Store app working at fullscreen of Android phone and Android tablet. Requires a lot time to setup, not recommended.

Related, for creating apps to other appstores: https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Browser-compatibility-matrix

1. https://www.pwabuilder.com to create Android app. Select fullscreen when creating app, also requires  correctly installed assetlinks.json with below Caddy config to get fullscreen. When creating app, make your own signing key if you don't have one yet. Releasing Android app is at Play Console https://play.google.com/console/ .

2. PWABuilder has about 100+ downloadable icons etc webmanifest requirements like is at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/main/public

3. Clone WeKan repo, add favicons etc from step 2 to wekan/public/ , and build WeKan bundle from source like at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Emoji . Note: Currently WeKan does not have feature for custom favicons, it would require a lot of work for 100+ favicons etc customizations.

4. Run bundle at server like https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Offline or https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Raspberry-Pi

5. Install Caddy like https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Caddy-Webserver-Config , with this config for PWA at https://boards.example.com , there add assetlinks.json details you got when you downloaded Android .zip file from https://pwabuilder.com , see assetlinks issue about where at Play Console those 2 SHA256 keys https://github.com/pwa-builder/PWABuilder/issues/3867#issuecomment-1450826565

6. At Play Console https://play.google.com/console/ there is `App Integrity` button in the sidemenu (highlighted blue in the screenshot) where you find required 2 SHA256 keys for Caddyfile:

7. Caddy uses tabs for indenting. At `/etc/caddy` you can also `caddy format > ca` to format output and forward to new file, and if it works then `mv ca Caddyfile` and validate it `caddy validate` and reload `caddy reload`. Sometimes update caddy with `caddy upgrade` and after that `caddy stop` and `caddy start`.

8. Also related is Parallel Snaps install to one server at encrypted VM at https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Many-Snaps-on-LXC

9. In newest requirements installing assetlinks.json is to PWA URL (like https://boards.example.com), when it before was to main domain (like https://example.com), so here just in case it's installed to both, as text in `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`. Also see https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/builder/android

10. For figuring out Caddy 2 config, xet7 found related tips from Caddy forum https://caddy.community/t/well-known-file-location/16632/4

`/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`

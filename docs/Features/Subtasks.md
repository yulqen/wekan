## Fix: If you are unable to create Subtasks

This can happen on old boards: You have Subtasks board missing.

1) Create new board similar to your original board, but with `^` at beginning and end of your boardname. For example, if your boardname is `MyProject`, create new board with name `^MyProject^`. At keyboard that character is `Shift-^-Space`.

2) Set your `MyProject` board to have subtask board `^MyProject^`

3) Now you are able to create Subtasks to your board `MyProject`.

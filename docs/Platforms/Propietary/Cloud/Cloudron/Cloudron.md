# Cloudron setup

Status:
- [Cloudron now uses upstream Wekan directly](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/3035), so Cloudron users get all Wekan newest features and fixes

Cloudron is a complete solution for running apps on your server and keeping them up-to-date and secure.

1. First install Cloudron on your server with 3 simple commands - https://cloudron.io/get.html
2. Install Wekan from the Cloudron Store. Once installed, you will get automatic updates for Wekan as and when they get released.
